                <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
                <p>I am Steve Odhiambo, an IT student at Mount Kigali University. I have been a teacher for 5 years now. My experience as a teacher has helped not only learn valuable things, but also I was able to see how schools struggle to communicate their identity to the community(If there is an identity). So, I decided to start this businesss with the aim of making sure that the schools I work with have a story to tell, beyond just grades. I believe that a school's identity is what helps schools meet with the right people. My passion in IT means that I can also help schools communicate their story online, increasing the reach and engagement of the school. Schools have a lot to offer the society, beyond grades.</p>
